###Data
The data set used is not included in this repository, but can be found at [ruth needs to fill in this link](). It is the full Human Microbiome Project data set. Here we have examined some sites in the mouth (tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, attached keratinized gingiva, hard palate, saliva) which are very similar, and have only subtle differences.
