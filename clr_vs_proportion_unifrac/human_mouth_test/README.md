Does CLR weighted UniFrac tease out subtle differences in human mouth microbiomes?
==========

###Data
The data set used is not included in this repository, but can be found on the [Human Microbiome Project QIIME Community Profiling webpage](http://www.hmpdacc.org/HMQCP/). Here we have examined some sites in the mouth (tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, attached keratinized gingiva, hard palate, saliva) which are very similar, and have only subtle differences.
